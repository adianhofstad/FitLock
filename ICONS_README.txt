ICON FILES NEEDED FOR PWA INSTALLATION
========================================

To enable full PWA installation on mobile devices, you need to create two icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Use a lock icon combined with fitness/BJJ imagery
- Dark background (#1a1a2e) with red/pink accent (#e94560)
- Simple, bold design that's recognizable at small sizes

QUICK SOLUTION:
You can generate these icons online at:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or create them in any image editor (Photoshop, Figma, Canva, etc.)

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
The app works perfectly without these files! The only feature you'll miss is the custom app icon when installing to home screen. The browser will use a default icon instead.

To test the app immediately: Just open index.html in your browser!
